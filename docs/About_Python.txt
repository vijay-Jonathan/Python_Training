Python Programming Language
-----------------------------
- Python also one of the programming language like C, C++, Java, Perl, Ruby Etc
- Python is one of OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE like C++, Java etc

WHY PYTHON?
- Open Source(Not required to buy any license) --> But still we have Java and other languages
- Easy to Learn -- Compare to other language like Java
- Readibility of code is more-- i.e, While coding, we can't mess the code in a file (Expects format)

Since it is "Easy to Learn" and "Readibility of code is more", because of this do we need to use python?????

NO NO???

Then WHY PYTHON?
We have more and more already avaiable code (Called as libraries).
Since, we have more and more libraries in python, Python is more popular

Now, Advantage will be we can make use of existing code for our project.
