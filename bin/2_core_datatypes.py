CORE DATA TYPES :

Similar to other languages, in python also we ALREADY have SOME options to store SOME kind of data.
In that,
1. int,float,hex,bin classes : ALREADY have option to store numbers like int, float, hex, bin, oct etc
2. str class : ALREADY have option to store Strings like "My Name", "My Addess" etc
3. list class : ALREADY have option to store collection of elements like list of students : After creating list,we CAN alter throught the program
4. tuple class : ALREADY have option to store collection of elements like list of students : After creating tuple,we CAN'T alter throught the program
5. dict class : ALREADY have option to store collection of elements like list of students : After creating dictionary,we CAN alter throught the program
    Why we need dictionary when we already have list?
    Answer :
        a) dict class help us to provide OWN index called key
        b) dict class help us to store json data
        c) dict class help us to store no-sql database data
6. set class :  ALREADY have option to store collection of elements like list of students : After creating set, we CAN alter throught the program
        Why we need set when we already have list/dict?
        Answer:
            a) set class help us to store/keep unique elements
            b) set class help us to perform sets and unions operations like union, intersection, difference etc

7. frozenset class : ALREADY have option to store collection of elements like list of students : After creating frozenset, we CAN'T alter throught the program

And Many More Classes are available, we will discuss throughout the course

Summary:
IMMUTABLE (We CAN'T modify)
-------------------------
1. number classes like int,float,hex,bin,oct etc
2. str class
3. tuple class
4. frozenset class

MUTABLE (We CAN modify)
1. list
2. dict
3. set
